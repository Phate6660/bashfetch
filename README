This is a pure-bash informmation fetching script.

Currently, the output is as follows on my machine:
$ ./bashfetch pacman
CPU:      AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx [4 cores, 8 threads]
DISTRO:   EndeavourOS
HOSTNAME: TUF-Gaming
KERNEL:   6.4.7-arch1-3
PACKAGES: 1722 (explicit) 2183 (total) | pacman
UPTIME:   0d 20h 4m

TODO:
- Better parsing of /etc/os-release for obtaining the distro
  as well as falling back to... I believe 3 other possible files
  if my memory serves me correctly in case /etc/os-release simply
  doesn't exist (there are a few distros which get rid of it)
- [DONE] Gather more methods of obtaining the hostname, as PLENTY of
  distros no longer use /etc/hostname
- Obtain the package counts on the system of various package managers:
  + apk (alpine)
  + apt/dpkg/pkg (ubuntu/debian-based, termux)
  + dnf/zypper/rpm (fedora/openSUSE-based)
  + flatpak (standalone)
  + [DONE?] pacman (arch-based)
  + portage (gentoo)
